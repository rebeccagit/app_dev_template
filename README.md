## Basic Application Development Template

This repository contains a basic development template for developing with Grunt and Sass.  It is meant to be a teaching tool.
To make it functional, you need to replace the missing code snippets with code blocks from the snippets file (in docs folder).  You can find the gaps in
the code by search for the string:

//*** INSERT SNIPPET ***//

The docs folder also contains a very rough tutorial on setting up your machine and working with Grunt.  This document cribs from the online documentation at [Gruntjs.com](http://gruntjs.com)
