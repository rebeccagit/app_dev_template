## Basic Application Development Template

This repository contains two versions of a  basic development template for developing with Grunt.  One is configured to compile Sass, and the other is
configured to compile LESS.

The docs folder also contains a very rough tutorial on setting up your machine and working with Grunt.
This document cribs from the online documentation at [Gruntjs.com](http://gruntjs.com)
